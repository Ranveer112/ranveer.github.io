                Hello there, I am Ranveer Randhawa, A rising sophomore at University of Washington. I am majoring in Computer Science, and minoring in Math. I spend a lot of my time reading, and implementing algorithms since competive programming is one of my hobbies. In addition, I sometimes also like to learn and experiment with neural networks. I have also devloped some projects in my free time. I have listed and described my favourite ones below.

                     Finds the shortest path in the maze using breadth first search. The cells of the maze are weighted by the values 0 and 1 only.<a href="https://github.com/Ranveer112/MazePathFinder">(Take a look)</a>

             <div class="SortVisualizer">
                <p>
                    An animation tool which visualizes the famous algorithm insertion sort. The reason this is one of my favourite ones is because I plan to devlop more algorithms in the future and create a compilation which could potentially help students.<a href="https://github.com/Ranveer112/Sort-Visualizer">(Take a look)</a>
